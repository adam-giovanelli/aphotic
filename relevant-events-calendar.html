  <h1>Relevant Events Calendar</h1>
  <p>There are many free resources available for finding events surrounding and affecting publicly traded companies directly.
    For example, your brokerage account dashboard probably highlights for you when the upcomining earnings dates are 
    for each of your investments. However, there don't seem to be any resources, at least available to the average retail
    trader, which would show you the upcoming events which may affect your investments more indirectly. For example, 
    every owner of Nvidia stock knows how important it is to track the capital expenditures of their customers, which
    creates a handful of earnings announcements to track just for that single line item.

    This project has multiple goals, each of increasingly large scope and complexity. Here is a quick outline for now:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Earnings dates of companies on an imported watchlist</li>
    <li>Earnings dates of "related" companies from watchlist</li>
    <li>Categorize related companies with tags: Competitor, customer, supplier 
    <li>Get other types of events such as conferences, trade shows, shareholders meetings, etc</li>
    <li>Add statistical impact of event in past</li>
    <li>Consider adding scheduled macro events</li>
    <li>Allow ETFs to be added, with weight of company in ETF shown for each stock specific event</li>
  </ul>
