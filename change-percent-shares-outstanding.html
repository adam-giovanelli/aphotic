  <p>
    An app that asks the user when they purchased their shares and how many shares they purchased,
    then plot out their growth in the percentage of shares outstanding over the years since their purchase. 
  </p>
  <p>The shares outstanding are required by the SEC to be reported on the front page, or in the introductory section,
    of each 10K filing. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Will need to also get stock split/reverse split dates and adjust the user's share count based on that. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Later, more complex features: account for share classes, show voting power, account for M&A (share transformations).
